GitHub is a web-based platform and a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, GitHub helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.
GitHub has various advantages but many people often have a doubt as to why not use drop box or any cloud-based system? Let me take the same example forward to answer this question. Say more than two software developers are working on the same file and they want to update it simultaneously. Unfortunately, the person who save the file first will get precedence over the others. While in GitHub, this is not the case. GitHub document the changes and reflect them in an organized manner to avoid any chaos between any of the files uploaded.Therefore, using GitHub centralized repository, it avoids all the confusion and working on the same code becomes very easy.
